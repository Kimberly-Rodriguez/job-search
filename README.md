# job-search

Description
This application will help a user to search for job listings based on their skills or interests, and will send a response to the Muse API to then show job listings to the user. The user can select a job listing and the application will then use the Learning Objects API to take the listing and link an external learning resource that can help the user understand the specific skill(s) that this particular job opportunity is looking for; additionally, these learning resources can guide the userâ€™s job application process, whether it be updating their resume, learning or strengthening their skillset. 

User story:
As a professional searching for my next employment opportunity, I want to use an application that allows me to search for a job listing based on job industry, and to show results of the search so that I can get a good understanding of current openings and ways to strengthen my knowledge.
